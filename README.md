# Anchor Tic Tac Toe with Svelte UI

The Backend is written in Anchor Lang, and the source code is tweaked from: https://book.anchor-lang.com/anchor_in_depth/milestone_project_tic-tac-toe.html, to make it playable.

The frontend framework is sveltekit, using shadcn-svelte, portal-payments's fork of solana wallet adapter 


## TODO
- polish UI
- better UX, dialog, toast...
- host on vercel
- check if any misuse of anchor 


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn 
yarn dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```





You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
